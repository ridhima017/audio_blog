As a part of IIITH Megathon,Stellantis, an automotive manufacturing corportion had given the problem statement of enchancing customer's experience for their automobiles.
Our solution to the above problem statement was focused on improving travel experiences by adding a feature that allows users to turn their memories into 
creative blogs throught their journey.
The idea was to record the user's experiences about a specific destination on their holiday and convert this audio to text and store it.At the end of the journey,text that was stored is put together in the form of a concise blog with the option of adding pictures as well.
The blogs can be made in multiple languages depending on the user's preference.
The code here is a basic prototype that was developed during the 24 hour hackathon.
